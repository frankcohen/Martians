Martians is a free GPL open source project.
See LICENSE for details.

Martians teaches:
- Wireless communication
- GPS location tracking
- Magnetometer (compass) tracking
- Data Serialization
- Real-time and multi-tasking software engineering
- 8-bit processor environments (Arduino)
- Battery operated and portable environments
- LED display technology

Instructions:
1) Buy the components. See below for a parts list. Cost in 2019 was less than $100 USD.
2) Wire the components. Follow the Wiring Guide.
3) Install the needed libraries to documents/arduino/libraries. See the list below.
4) Create a new Arduino IDE sketch/Project
5) Set the radioNumber value for the first Martian to 0, the second Martian to 1
6) Compile MartiansAtMakerFaire2019.ino in Arduino IDE and upload to the Mega board
7) Repeat 5-6 for the second Martian
8) Have fun with your Martians

Jim Hensonâ€™s Muppets work on Sesame Street inspired this project:
