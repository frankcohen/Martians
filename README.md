Neo7 GPS board, https://www.ebay.com/i/273760042170?chn=ps
Magnetometer, https://learn.adafruit.com/lsm303-accelerometer-slash-compass-breakout/coding
WS2812b LED strip, http://bit.ly/2W06RPd
Arduino Mega

Software libraries:
TinyGPS+
Adafruit_Sensor and Adafruit_LSM303_U to read compass and accelerometer
ArduinoJson - serialize and deserialize data between Martians
FastLED - drives LED display
